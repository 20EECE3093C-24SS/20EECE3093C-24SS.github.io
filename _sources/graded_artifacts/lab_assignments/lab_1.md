Due Date: Tuesday, January 23, 2024 at 11:59pm

1. Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/join) (5pts)

:::{important}
Employers may take your GitHub username into consideration, so it's important to choose one that is professional. Similar to your professional email, your GitHub username should ideally be a variation of your name. Avoid using Twitter handles, gamertags, or any monikers that do not resemble your actual name. A username devoid of unprofessional language or content can leave a positive impression.
