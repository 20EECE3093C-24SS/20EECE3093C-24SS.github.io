# Lab 2 - GitHub Project Management

This lab assignment, commencing on Tuesday, February 6, is designed to facilitate tracking your progress throughout the semester. While the initial setup is due at the start, the actual grading will occur at the semester's end. Evaluation will be based on the consistency of usage, the quality, and the completeness of your work over the entire semester. 

Please note that throughout the semester, there will be spot checks to monitor your usage of the tool. Each time you are found not to be using the tool, points will be deducted from your final project grade.
