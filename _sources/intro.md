# Software Engineering

## 20EECE3093C - Spring 2024

**Instructor**: [Brian Loudin](https://researchdirectory.uc.edu/p/loudinbk)<br>

Introduction to software engineering and formal methods. General course topics include software lifecycle models, requirements analysis, specification, design, testing and maintenance. The course introduces students to formal methods, global software engineering, and ethics for software engineering. In the lab sessions, students apply concepts taught in lecture, and develop a large group project. - 


The class meets two times a week for lectures. Additionally, individual groups meet twice a week during section (Tuesday and Thursday) for team and project meetings. All class meetings are in-person. Classroom material is enhanced with assigned readings, in-class activities, and in-class exercises.

## Attendance and Participation


Lab sections are not required, do not feature mandatory participation, and do not assess attendance. All discussion section materials are made available online.


To reduce student stress and provide support for individual circumstances, each student may miss two quizes without excuse without penalty. You do not need to report or request anything; these will be applied automatically.

## Late policy

Assignments must be submitted on Canvas by the due date and time. Unless otherwise noted, all times are given in EST (Eas Time). The submission site remains open for 24 hours after the deadline. Assignments submitted within 24 hours after the deadline will incur a 20% penalty. Assignments will not be accepted after the submission site is closed.

You can find the general course policies here.

## Acknowledgements

This course is inspired by a number of other courses in software engineering at other universities, including:

Jon Bell’s CS 4530 at Northeastern.
Wes Weimer’s EECS 481 at the University of Michigan
Michael Ernst’s CSE 403 at the University of Washington

As a student, if you’re looking for more materials (or just a different perspective) on any of the topics we cover, you might start with those (excellent) courses.
